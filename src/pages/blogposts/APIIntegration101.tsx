                Over the past month, in my current role as Head of Platforms and
                Integrations, I have had the opportunity to interview over 50
                candidates for API Integration roles. Through these interviews,
                I've noticed a knowledge gap in certain areas which include
                system design patterns, API user management, integration
                concepts, and API specifications.

                are eager to learn and grow in this field.

                  modern API platforms, allowing organizations to serve multiple
                  client types through a unified gateway while maintaining
                  proper separation and security.

                  of a network communicate with each other. There are seven (7)
                  layers in the OSI model which have their specific functions

                  two layers i.e the application & network layer.

                  APIs (Application Programmable Interface) are a set of clearly
                  defined methods of communication between two pieces of
                  software. The most important step of software integration is
                  understanding the API user guide, which is often embedded
                  within the API documentation.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">

                <p className="mb-4">
                  The API specification describes the functionality and expected
                  behavior of an API. It standardizes the data exchange between
                  web services, examples of these specifications include
                  GraphQL, REST, SOAP etc. Let's use REST APIs as a case study
                  for expatiating on API.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    REST stands for Representational State Transfer. In this
                    specification, clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The hypertext transfer protocol is the foundation of the
                    World Wide Web, and it is used to load webpages using
                    hypertext links. The HTTP is an application layer protocol
                    designed to transfer information between networked devices
                    and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol
                    stack.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    A simple flow over HTTP occurs by a client (user) making a
                    request to a server which then responds with a message.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    HTTP protocol requests are made up of a URL, method, headers
                    and body.

                    Creating an IP whitelist for your API key ensures the key is
                    only valid when the API is being accessed from a registered
                    and pre-approved IP address.

                  <p className="mb-0">
                    IP connection whitelisting occurs at two layers of the OSI
                    model i.e the network and application layer. On the network
                    layer, it is important to whitelist the client side IP and
                    port addresses on the server side. Whilst on the application
                    layer, the API user will store & send each request with the
                    API key in the header.

                  As an Integration PM, you are expected to understand all of
                  the above and then analyze each endpoint, their
                  functionalities, and how it will all fit your business
                  requirements. Once the alignment between business requirement
                  and API feature is completed, then an Integration document
                  should be created and must include certain key elements which

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    An example could be an online order management system that
                    requires payment acceptance. In this use case, there is a
                    requirement for the integration of a payment service
                    provider. The requirement here is clear and the order
                    management system needs a flow whereby its users can
                    complete a purchase online and receive value.

                      <p>
                        Conceptually this can be defined using UML's, to
                        visualize the flow between the user, actions taken, the
                        request and the response involved. I often use
                        flowcharts to communicate user flows to my development
                        team.

                      <p>
                        In this use case, the first step is to conceptually
                        define how this payment system will flow into your order
                        management user experience. The next step will be to
                        build the UI which essentially defines the scope of the
                        integration. The UX designer must have built a low or
                        high level flow to incorporate both pieces of software
                        to enable a user seamlessly complete a purchase. A front
                        end engineer will bring the design to life by hardcoding
                        and applying each step to its backend endpoints.

                      <p>
                        There is a bit of system design pattern consideration
                        here. Assumption, where the order management system
                        leverages a micro service architecture, the decision to
                        be made will be to develop a payment micro service with
                        a server-less DB. This Server less DB will store all
                        attributes of the payment service provider and connect
                        the order check out directly to the third party service
                        provider (Payment service). This backend integration
                        process is not a one size fits all but is highly
                        adaptable. There are many ways to go about the backend
                        integration depending on the system architecture,
                        dependencies, patterns and other such factors.

                      <p>
                        This essentially describes the checks and balances
                        between two systems. In our use case, payment occurs on
                        the order management system however it is processed by
                        the payment service provider. There are going to be
                        successful, unsuccessful and pending transactions
                        between these two systems and this process has to be
                        defined clearly to enable both parties to understand how
                        to handle these cases efficiently. An example of
                        settlement processes include T + 1 which means
                        settlement happens after a day on all accounts.

                        for our use case it is popular. Automating this process
                        also ties back into the reconciliation and settlement
                        process. Developing the commissions flow into the
                        reconciliation process is key and very important in the
                        case of charge backs, refunds etc.
